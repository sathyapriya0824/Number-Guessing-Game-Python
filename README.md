Operating System: Windows

📖 Project Description:

This project allows the user to guess a number randomly generated by the computer between 1 and 50.
The program performs the following operations:
Generates a random number using the random module
Prompts the user to enter a guess
Compares the guess with the generated number

Displays feedback:

“Too High” if the guess is greater
“Too Low” if the guess is smaller
Success message if correct

Continues execution until the correct number is guessed
Displays the total number of attempts taken
